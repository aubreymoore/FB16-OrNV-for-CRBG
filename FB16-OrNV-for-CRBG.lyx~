Objectives and Need for Assistance (Extracted from the FB Suggestion and
 Workplan)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The abstract from the Farm Bill Suggestion for this project provides a useful
 introduction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The population of coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB) recently established
 on Guam is genetically distinct from other populations of this major palm
 pest and it is being referred to as the CRB-G biotype.
 CRB-G is resistant to Oryctes nudivirus, which is the major biocontrol
 agent for CRB, and it appears to have other characteristics which make
 it more invasive and harder to control than other CRB biotypes.
 While there where no range expansions of CRB for a quarter of a century
 (1980 to 2005), CRB is now on the move with the invasion of Guam in 2007,
 the Port Moresby area of Papua New Guinea in 2009, Oahu, Hawaii in 2013,
 and the Honiara area of Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands in 2015.
 It is significant that all of these new invasions involve CRB-G.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This FB suggestion is a request for funding to be used as seed money to
 organize an international collaborative project with the goal of discovering
 a strain of 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros
\emph default
 nudivirus (OrNV) or other microbial biocontrol agent which is highly pathogenic
 for CRB-Guam, to hire a graduate research assistant and to establish a
 insect pathology laboratory on Guam to evaluate candidate biocontrol agents
 discovered during foreign exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following subsections (2.1 through 2.3) come from the approved work plan
 for the FY2016 Farm Bill Grant.
 They describe the CRB-G situation at the beginning of the grant performance
 period, August 1, 2016.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Urgent Need to Mitigate Mature Palm Mortality Caused by CRB-G on Guam
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mortality of mature palms on Guam has increased dramatically over the past
 year as a result of abundant new breeding sites in the form of decaying
 vegetation left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which visited Guam in May
 2015.
 It appears that the typhoon triggered a positive feedback cycle where CRB
 adults are numerous enough to kill large numbers of mature palms.
 The resulting dead standing coconut stems become optimum breeding sites
 which produce even higher numbers of adults.
 Uncontrolled outbreaks such as this occurred in Palau and Fiji, resulting
 in coconut palm mortality of 50% or more.
 Current tactics of trapping, sanitation, and application of 
\emph on
Metarhizium majus
\emph default
 may reduce local damage but are ineffective in preventing wide-spread island-wi
de damage because most breeding sites are inaccessible, in jungle and/or
 on military bases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an urgent need to find and release an effective isolate of OrNV,
 or another effective density-dependent biocontrol agent, for CRB-G.
 Without a rapid response, most of Guam's palms may be killed and the risk
 of accidental transport of CRB-G to other islands is high.
 If CRB-G invades atolls where coconut is still 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the tree of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or islands where coconut and/or oil palms are major crops this could lead
 to a humanitarian disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Need for Regional Collaboration to Manage CRB-G on Pacific Islands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CRB-G biotype issue is a new emergent pest problem that has Pacific
 islands entomologists very worried.

The Pacific Plant Protection Organization (PPPO) met in Fiji during the
 week of September 21, 2015, attended by reps from 22 Pacific Island countries
 and territories, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, AgResearch New
 Zealand, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United
 States Department of Agriculture, and federal governments of Australia
 and New Zealand.
 CRB-G was discussed at length.
 Jackson's suggestions were endorsed by the PPPO and the Pacific Community
 (SPC) was asked to assist in formulating plans and finding funding for
 a regional collaboration to implement these suggestions.
 In addition, it was suggested that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exploration of effective biological control candidates, especially virus
 from the native range of the CRB-G biotype.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be a priority action item.
 Although success in finding an effective OrNV isolate is not guaranteed,
 experts suggest there is a high probability of finding such an isolate
 infecting beetles near the origin of the CRB-G biotype.
 An endemic population of CRB-G has been found on Negros Island in the Philippin
es.
 In addition, Palau has CRB-G and other CRB biotypes.
 This grant will support a two weeks of field work by Moore, Marshall, and
 Iriarte in Palau and the Philippines.
 The major objective is to find an effective biocontrol agent for CRB-G
 and a secondary objective is to develop and test protocols for further
 foreign exploration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SPC sponsored a workshop in Fiji during June 1-3, 2016.
 A half-day session during this workshop was on the topic

Results or Benefits Expected
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign exploration leading to discovery of a highly pathogenic strain of
 OrNV or other microbial biocontrol agent for CRB-Guam could lead to implementat
ion of self sustaining population suppression and tolerable damage levels
 on Guam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Loss of 50% or more of Guam's palms may be prevented if an effective biocontrol
 agent is found and released quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduction in CRB population levels on Guam will reduce the risk of accidental
 transport of the highly invasive CRB-Guam biotype to other Pacific islands
 and elsewhere An effective biocontrol agent for Guam's CRB infestation
 will be useful against CRB-Guam invasions elsewhere.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A contract using funds from this grant was prepared to facilitate collaboration
 between UOG and AgResearch New Zealand, the home institution for Dr.
 Sean Marshall and Dr.
 Trevor Jackson, world experts on biocontrol of CRB using OrNV.
 Support of the existing collaboration with colleagues at AgResearch is
 essential to this project because they have the skills and facilities to
 detect OrNV, genotype CRB, and propagate OrNV.
 Dr.
 Marshall joined Aubrey Moore and Ian Iriarte in a trip to Negros Island,
 Philippines to search for an isolate of OrNV which is an effective biocontrol
 agent for CRB-G.

Activities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous years, we tested several isolates of OrNV from AgResearch New
 Zealand and some from virus-infected beetles in Fiji.
 We did not observe significant mortality during many bioassays, leading
 us to the conclusion that CRB-G is resistant to OrNV 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, to confirm that we do not have OrNV pathogenic for CRB-G, we have
 started a series of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

witch's brew
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bioassays.
 Frozen, dead beetles from all previous bioassays were added to one liter
 of water and made into an aqueous slurry using a blender.
 Vials containing remnants of virus samples from AgResearch New Zealand
 were agitated in 500 ml of water, and this suspension was added to the
 blender.
 The slurry was poured into a small pail and forty beetles were made to
 swim in this for thirty minutes.
 A control group of beetles was made to swim in water for thirty minutes.
 Beetles were kept in a large container filled with moist, commercially
 blended steer manure and soil.
 All beetles were checked weekly.
 Dead beetles were recorded and frozen.

 However, control mortality is high, about 30-40%, mainly due to the fungal

 We have attempted to filter out fungal spores by passing the brew through
 a serious of filters with the last stage being a Millipore 0.45 micron filter,
 which should block all fungal spores while allowing virus particles to
 pass through.
 Unfortunately, this idea has not worked because filters get totally plugged.

Foreign Exploration for an Effective Biocontrol Agent for CRB-G

Activities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In January 2017 Moore, Iriarte and Marshall visited Dumaguete, Negros Island,
 Philippines.
 The objective of this trip was to begin searching for new OrNV isolates
 that could be effective against the CRB-G haplotype.
 Native habitats provide a good opportunity to identify candidate OrNV isolates
 (and other potential biocontrol agents).
 OrNV is known to be widespread across the Philippines, where CRB is considered
 as native, and the CRB-G haplotype has been identified from the Dumaguete
 area.
 We had planned to visit Palau during the same trip.
 But we decided to concentrate our efforts in the Philippines because our
 Hawaiian colleagues had already initiated work with CRB and OrNV in Palau.

\begin_layout Itemize
CRB tissue samples were obtained from live CRB adults collected using both
 pheromone trapping and hand collection from the Philippines.
 Gross observation and molecular DNA analyses were used to determine the
 OrNV infection status and haplotype of individual specimens.
 The pheromone trapping results were disappointing, with only a single CRB
 adult caught; however, hand collection enabled a number of adults and larvae
 to be collected.
 From the CRB specimens collected in the Philippines, one OrNV infected
 CRB adult was identified.
 This specimen was confirmed to be of the CRB-G haplotype, and OrNV from
 the infected tissue was isolated to prepare inoculum for testing efficacy
 against CRB-G.
 Details of the trip and subsequent analysis and results are detailed in
 the report attached as [

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Next Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An OrNV isolate extracted from a single CRB-G adult was purified and propagated
 in Dr.
 Marshall's lab at AgResearch, New Zealand.
 A USDA APHIS import permit was applied for and has been issued to allow
 shipment of this OrNV isolate to Guam where it will be tested to evaluate
 its usefulness as a biocontrol agent for CRB-G on Guam.
